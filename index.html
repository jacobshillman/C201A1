    <h1>All about me! (yay.)</h1>
    <h3>Early life</h3>
      <p>  I was born, and learned to walk around and talk and stuff. Apparently, I
      was somewhat accident prone - not because I'm clumsy, but because I just didn't
      have any fear. ...aand growing up outside of Casper, WYO there were plenty of
      things to not have any fear of.  :)</p>
    <h3>Not so early life</h3>
      <p>  Grade school, junior high and high school were, well: school. I worked my
      way through California State University, Bakersfield for a triple BA in English, Philosophy and Psychology. I did manage to keep school from getting in the way of my education, though; and participated in several clubs, student government and Greek life. Ultimately, I found what I wanted to do when I grew up: research in Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>
    <h3>Post college</h3>
      <p>  After finishing my BA, I began a MA in Psychology with an emphasis in Cognitive Neuroscience, specializing in the electrophysiological correlates of visual consciousness and attention. During the second term of my program, I was deployed for the invasion of Iraq. Apparently, war and graduate school have a long-lasting aversion, so I completed all but the thesis for my MA.</p>
      <p>  Since then I've been formally trained in IT, deployed a second time, became a technical writer and, most recently, an electronics maintenance person. The best and most important thing I've done is find and marry my wonderful wife. :)</p>
