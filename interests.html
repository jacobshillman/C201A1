          <p>'Cause who doesn't love the thought of being blown up and par boiled all at once!?!</p>
          <p>There are at least 4 super volcanoes in the continental US:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Yellowstone (big "Duh!" there...)<br>
              Relax, knowing that Portland is <span class="emphasis">just</span> outside the kill radius if it does go...</li>
            <li>Long Valley (i.e. Mammoth - yeah, the skiing hotspot in CA!)</li>
            <li>La Garrita (In SW Colorado)</li>
            <li>Valles Caldera (Northern New Mexico)</li>
          </ul>
        <p>So, you see that we're really well populated for extinction-level event volcanoes in here in the good 'ol US of A!!!</p></td>
        <td class="items"><h4>Research</h4>
          <p>I've always loved learning. ...aand being mildly Autistic, I love learning ALL about stuff (usually something random that strikes my fancy). Having worked in professional Neuroscience Research, both as a grad student and as full-time support staff, I've got a very strong skillset to deploy for learning cool stuff.</p>
          <p>I also have my brown belt at Google. :)</p>
        </td>
        <td class="items"><h4>Technology</h4>
          <p>I have the need, the need for gizmos!! I love tech-ee things. ...but not for the sake of having a 'gee-whiz' doo-dad sitting on my desk: I like parsimonious solutions to real challenges. Tech offers a lot of potential solutions to a lot of little things.</p>
          <p>For example: Ceiling fans can circulate warm air (obviously during cold weather) around the house, but kinda suck to have on when the heater's been off for a while. So, wouldn't it be cool if there was a gadget that switched on the ceiling fans when the furnace fan kicked on?? ...and switched them back off a couple minutes after the furnace shut off??</p>

          Yep. I'm a news junkie. It's routine for me to crash my browser because I have 37 tabs with different articles I want to read from media sites.

        <td class="items"><h4>Fixin' Things!</h4>
          I think this is an offshoot of researching and technology. I've always liked working with my hands, and there's real pride in making something that stopped working, work again.
          <p>I'd also like to throw out there: I don't know how many times being able to fix stuff has kept me from walking...</p>
        </td>
        <td class="items"><h4>Fantasy</h4>
          Fantasy novels, role playing games, movies, online games - all good in my little world. I enjoy the escapism and the stories, but most importantly: I think in movies (like, when I think, it's in moving pictures), which translates into a <span class="emphasis">really</span> vivid imagination! :)
