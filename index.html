      <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p class="nar">  I was born, and learned to walk around and talk and stuff. Apparently, I
        was somewhat accident prone - not because I'm clumsy, but because I just didn't
        have any fear. ...aand growing up outside of Casper, WYO there were plenty of
        things to not have any fear of.  :)</p>
      <h3>Not so early life</h3>
        <p class="nar">  Grade school, junior high and high school were, well: school. I worked my
        way through <a href="http://www.csub.edu">California State University, Bakersfield</a> for a triple BA in English, Philosophy and Psychology. I did manage to keep school from getting in the way of my education, though; and participated in several clubs, student government and Greek life. Ultimately, I found what I wanted to do when I grew up: research in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience">Cognitive Neuroscience.</a></p>
      <h3>Post college</h3>
        <p class="nar">  After finishing my BA, I began a MA in Psychology with an emphasis in Cognitive Neuroscience, specializing in the electrophysiological correlates of visual consciousness and attention. During the second term of my program, I was deployed for the invasion of Iraq. Apparently, war and graduate school have a long-lasting aversion, so I completed all but the thesis for my MA.</p>
        <p class="nar">  Since then I've been formally trained in IT, deployed a second time, became a technical writer and, most recently, an electronics maintenance person. See below for a longer list of the <a href="#stuff">Stuff I've Done</a>. However, the best and most important thing I've done is find and marry my wonderful wife. :)</p>
      <h3>My favorites</h3>
        <p class="nar">I enjoy reading, sailing, biking, researching stuff, and working on my <span id="car">1965 Mustang</span>. Ultimately (someday...), I hope to be an author. I've had the pleasure of working as a technical writer and also of writing for fun - and I <em>LOVED</em> every second of it! :)</p>
